# Stair-Shield
Used Kicad version 4.0.1
Used PCBNew 4.0.1

On PCB version 1.0
Had initially vias set to 0.6 mm with a drill of 0.4mm. PCB Tools said that rest material should be at least 0.15mm and therefore increased vias to 0.7mm with the same drill.

PCB Version 1.1
Corrected the above and remove vias from texts. Also changed the design rules to have at least vias of 0.7mm
